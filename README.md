  <strong>The Nuclear Wasteland</strong> throws you into the aftermath of a world-ending detonation. You were deep underground when the world above burnedâ€”now, you emerge into silence. The land is scarred, lifeless, and cloaked in a thick yellow fog. Poisoned rain, mutated wildlife, and radiation-soaked ruins stretch endlessly in every direction. <strong>Survival here isn't guaranteed.</strong>
</p>

<p align="center">
  Built around a tightly woven narrative, <strong>The Nuclear Wasteland</strong> offers a semi-guided progression experience through quests and discoveries. Youâ€™ll begin by scraping together the remnants of civilizationâ€”gathering Dead Logs, purifying poisoned water, and unearthing clay from blasted terrain. As you grow in strength and understanding, you'll unlock powerful tools, automation, and protection against the irradiated world around you.
</p>

<p align="center">
  But this world may never be home again. The ultimate goal: to leave. Reach for the stars with <strong>Ad Astra</strong>, and escape the poisoned Earth to carve out a future among the planets.
